# Assignment

_Completed for a prospective client_

* Create a new page called Product Listing
* Create a new sidebar component that matches with the overall pattern (Note this is a isomorphic application )


## What was done?

**To add a Product Listing Page:**

* Create a ProductListing.jsx container and stubbed the .css file
* Modify the Routes file to know how to handle the product-listing request
* Update the nav to allow users to visit the page

**To add a sidebar:**

* Create a Sidebar.jsx container and install it into the App.jsx container
* Mimicked styling from previous CSS components
* Modified App.jsx and .css so that they center properly
* Test that the `<Message>` container renders fine by manually flipping it on and rendering


## Where to see the work?

Please review [the diff](https://github.com/Albert/react-webpack-node/compare/e8d42bcdb723a8f08d68c24078a7aa433fda2141...feef1e7657eddfa0150a2561fccb9d5b0fa3e759) of all changes (minus this README)


## What was learned?

As this was my first hands-on experience with React, I learned a lot.  It was sort of a perfect assignment to introduce me to the React ecosystem.

When compared to Ember, it feels more controlled and confined with fewer, but bigger design choices.  JSX is also very cool -- don't quite see why it gets a bad rap.

Also cool to learn about "classNames" and "CSS Modules".  Weird at first... a tad too fragmented in an app this sparce, but I can see how it would be useful in the long run.


## What went beyond the original task?

Nothing additional was done, but I'm happy to implement more changes if requested.
